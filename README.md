This is a fun app I used to get some experience with Alexa Skills.
This app won't be much use to anyone else as I've got a fair amount
of functionality hard-coded into it that's specific to my use case.

If I'm feeling frisky I'll generalize it and make the skill public.

## Further reading

There are a few examples of deveolping skills in the
[skills cookbook](https://alexa.design/cookbook).

## Usage

Make sure the project is installed in the virtual Env, and then run:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```
